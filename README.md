This is a collection of "dotfiles" I use in my personal environment. I'm posting it publicly mainly so that I can quickly and easily bring it onto any given system, even ones that I don't trust enough to give an SSH key. If others find these files interesting or educational, that's a nice bonus.

The `emplace.sh` script expects this repo to be placed in `~/.dotfiles`, e.g. by:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SolraBizna/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
```

Here a "dotfile" is defined as a small file, usually stored in the home directory, designed to be human-editable, that customizes the appearance or behavior of a utility. So `~/.zshrc` is a dotfile, `~/.emacs.d/init.el` is a dotfile, `~/.config/awesome/rc.lua` is a dotfile...

There's nothing here complicated enough to be worth dithering about licenses.
